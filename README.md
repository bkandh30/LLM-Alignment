# LLM-Alignment

## Introduction

Simplified alignment techniques aim to enhance the reasoning performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in long-form question answering. However, this simplification may come at the cost of reasoning depth and accuracy in complex tasks.

Our study aims to evaluate how simplified alignment affects the reasoning benchmarks like MMLU and GSM8K, examining the trade-offs between clarity and reasoning performance.

We hypothesize that simplification could result in changes to reasoning quality, offering both potential benefits and drawbacks.

## Datasets

### Alignment Datasets

- ELI5 Dataset

### Evaluation Dataset

- MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding)
- GSM8K (Grade School Math 8K)

## Proposed Solution

## Performance Evaluation

## Real-World Application

-Designing Adaptive LLMs: Develop models that can switch between clarity-focused and reasoning-intensive modes based on task-requirements.
-Applications in Education and Accessibility: Simplified alignment can be used to make complex concepts more accessible in educational tools and customer support systems

- Informing Alignment Strategies: Guide the development of future alignment techniques that balance usability with reasoning performance.

## Conclusion

This study evaluates the impact of simplified alignment on the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. By exploring the trade-offs between clarity and reasoning depth using benchmarks like MMLU and GSM8K, it highlights the challenges and opportunities in designing aligned models.

## Future Work

- Extend alignment evaluation to other styles, such as ethical or factual alignment.
- Explore adaptive alignment strategies that dynamically adjust to task-specific requirements.
- Focus on evaluating reasoning chain better.
- Investigate scalability and computational efficiency in alignment techniques.
